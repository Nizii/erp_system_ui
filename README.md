# ERP System UI

This project was about creating a full stack application from design to the implementation of the front and back end. The system contains three tables (Contacts, Bills and Products) where you can add, update or delete data. Furthermore, the system has a registration and a login page.
For more details about the **backend** see my other repository on this project [https://github.com/Nizii/erp_system_api](https://github.com/Nizii/)

# Design process
During the design process, I first worked with wireframes, then I created the design with Moodboard.
In order to make the work realistic, I was able to do the project on the basis of the requirements from a friend who is a plumber and has a company. Together we worked out his requirements for the system this includes SLA.
